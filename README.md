# Socket Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of simple networking projects built using socket programming. The projects aim to help me become more familiar with socket programming concepts and techniques.

## Motivation

I am deeply curious about socket programming and its role in building networked applications. By working on these projects, I aim to expand my knowledge and gain hands-on experience with different aspects of socket programming. These projects are undertaken voluntarily as a personal initiative to enhance my skills and explore the fascinating world of networking.

## Projects

The repository includes the following projects:

1. Echo Server: An echo server that echoes back messages received from clients.

Each project is organized in its own directory and contains a GIF demo showcasing how it works.

Please note that these projects were developed and tested on macOS. While the code may work on other platforms, there can be differences in system calls and behavior between macOS and other operating systems. It is recommended to test the programs on macOS for optimal compatibility.

## Contribution

This repository is a personal learning initiative, and contributions are not expected. However, if you discover any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I appreciate any feedback that can help enhance the projects or provide additional learning opportunities.
